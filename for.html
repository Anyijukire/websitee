        <h3> In born a crime by Trevor Noah (Novel) the author tries to potray very many concepts that are still
         taking place int he present world. <br> The paragraph below caught my attention. page 253 </h3>
        <p>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered 
       why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that 
       in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being 
       raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman 
       to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. 
      “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” 
      she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.  </p>

      <div class="grid-item item2"><img src="janet.png" class="pic"></div>
      <div class="grid-item item3">In this context, I realise that there's a theme of gender ineqality; <br>
    This is potrayed when Able expects Patricia to behave like the traditional women where the man is superior 
    and the woman is inferior. <br> There is also a theme of independence as potrayed by Patricia. She is aware
    of what her abilities are, she knows she can be able to survive even when she has no husband. <br>
    I also notices that there's superiolity as Able feels he can be capable of controlling an independent
    woman like Patricia. I find this so irritating because it's stated clearly that there are women trained 
    specifically for that back in his village.<br> Finally, I will talk about the theme of love.
    this is potrayed as Able and Patricia fall in love even if they know it might not end well; this being brought
    about by the difference in their statuses and what they both expect from each other.

          <h3>Blog2  </h3>
          <h4>In this blog I want to talk about the humor potrayed in this novel. </h4>
<p> <i>Sometimes in big Hollywood movies they'll have these crazy chase scenes where somebody jumps or gets thrown
    from a moving car. The person hits the ground and rolls for a bit. Then they come to a stop and pop up and dust
    themselves off, like its no big deal. Whenever I see that I think, Thats rubbish. Getting thrown out of a moving
    car hurts away worse than that. (pg1)
</i> <br> In this paragraph Trevor Noah uses humor to talk about how fictional the Hollywood movies are so that there
is no offence. He uses his words and makes it so ironical and very humerous at the same time. I can just imagine 
the pain he felt at nine years that he still recalls that incident when he watches the movies.
</p>
<p> <i>I got up on stage and Tom did some terrible beat-boxing __ "Bff badff, bff bff badff"__ while I starmbled 
    through some Busta rhymes lyrics that I made up as I went along. The audience erupted with cheers and applause
. An American rapper had come to Hammanskraal and it was the most epic thing they had ever seen. so thats Tom.
</i> <br> In this paragraph on page 166, He uses humor to save his friend Tom and get him out of trouble because 
Tom had already collected the money from the people in Hammanskraal to bring to them an  American rapper  who he 
didn't have. Just because Trevor knew abit af the rhymes and had timberland shoes, he was able to save his friend
Tom by entertaining the people in Hammanskraal.
